            <h2 class="sec_heading">Advanture Time</h2>
            <p class="text">If we were to imagine Adventure Time characters engaging in biking, paragliding, and surfing, it would certainly be a fun and adventurous sight!<br>
               <b> Biking:</b> Finn, being the adventurous and energetic character he is, would likely excel at biking. Imagine Finn riding a specially crafted bike through the Candy Kingdom, with Jake transforming into various forms to accompany him along the way. They might encounter challenges like racing through obstacle courses or going on epic quests across different landscapes.<br>
                <b>Paragliding:</b> Princess Bubblegum, known for her scientific prowess and creativity, could invent a paraglider made from bubblegum material. She and Marceline might explore the skies above the Land of Ooo, gliding gracefully over the Candy Mountains or the Ice Kingdom. Their adventures could involve discovering hidden treasures or encountering airborne creatures.<br>
                <b>Surfing:</b> Jake, with his shape-shifting abilities, could transform into a surfboard while Finn takes on the waves. They might surf on the ocean near the Fire Kingdom, navigating through waves created by Flame Princess or even catching waves on the Crystal Dimension's beaches. Their surfing adventures could involve friendly competitions or even surfing competitions organized by the inhabitants of Ooo.<br>
                In each scenario, the Adventure Time characters would bring their unique personalities and abilities to these activities, adding humor, excitement, and a touch of whimsy to their adventures.</p>

            <h2 class="sec_heading">Biking</h2>
            <p class="text">The bicycle has been used as a method of reconnaissance as well as transporting soldiers and supplies to combat zones. In this it has taken over many of the functions of horses in warfare. In the Second Boer War, both sides used bicycles for scouting. In World War I, France, Germany, Australia and New Zealand used bicycles to move troops. In its 1937 invasion of China, Japan employed some 50,000 bicycle troops, and similar forces were instrumental in Japan's march or "roll" through Malaya in World War II. Germany used bicycles again in World War II, while the British employed airborne "Cycle-commandos" with folding bikes.
                In the Vietnam War, communist forces used bicycles extensively as cargo carriers along the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
                The last country known to maintain a regiment of bicycle troops was Switzerland, which disbanded its last unit in 2003.</p>

            <h2 class="sec_heading">Paragliding</h2>
            <p class="text">Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a harness or in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.
                Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.
                As with all aircraft, launching and landing are done into wind. The wing is placed into an airstream, either by running or being pulled, or an existing wind. The wing moves up over the pilot into a position in which it can carry the passenger. The pilot is then lifted from the ground and, after a safety period, can sit down into his harness. Unlike skydivers, paragliders, like hang gliders, do not jump at any time during this process. There are two launching techniques used on higher ground and one assisted launch technique used in flatland</p>

            <h2 class="sec_heading">Surfing:</h2>
            <p class="text">Surfing is a water sport done in the ocean or sea. The surfer uses their surfboard to catch a wave and ride in towards the shore.<br>
                Surfing was invented by the Polynesians at least 4000 years ago. Surfing made its Olympic debut at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. It has become a popular sport among both men and women of all ages. With lifestyles and regimens freer than those of most sports, surfers comprise a unique culture. Though surfing is practiced in many other Pacific nations, its center remains Hawaii, where many rounds of the international surfing championships (the ASP) are held annually. Surfing is popular in Australia, the US, and Northern Europe.</p>
